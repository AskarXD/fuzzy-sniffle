Verse 1:
I'm coding away, making changes to my code
Working hard to make it run like it should
But I know I can't keep it just on my machine
So I commit it to the remote repo on GitHub

Chorus:
Git push, Git push, that's how we get things done
From local to remote, it's all about that fun
Git push, Git push, with just a simple command
My changes are safe and sound in the cloud land

Verse 2:
I check my changes, and everything looks fine
My code is clean, and the tests all pass on time
I add a commit message, so I know what I've done
Then I push it up to GitHub, just like a run

Chorus:
Git push, Git push, that's how we get things done
From local to remote, it's all about that fun
Git push, Git push, with just a simple command
My changes are safe and sound in the cloud land

Verse 3:
On GitHub, I can see my changes clear as day
All my code is there, in the best possible way
I can check the logs, to see what I've done before
And I can share my work with people galore

Chorus:
Git push, Git push, that's how we get things done
From local to remote, it's all about that fun
Git push, Git push, with just a simple command
My changes are safe and sound in the cloud land

Verse 4:
So when you're working on your code, remember this song
And don't forget to push your changes where they belong
With Git push, Git push, it's easy as can be
To share your work with the world, for all to see

Chorus:
Git push, Git push, that's how we get things done
From local to remote, it's all about that fun
Git push, Git push, with just a simple command
My changes are safe and sound in the cloud land.

Some extra words are added to an already impeccable song
